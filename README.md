# Scatter-Gather-Sample

Implement Scatter-Gather message routing pattern using .NET C# and Azure Durable Functions. 

The Scatter-Gather pattern is a message routing pattern that takes a request, distributes it to multiple recipients, and aggregates the results into a single response.

Scatter-Gather forwards a request message to multiple recipients.

It then uses an aggregator to collect the responses and distills it into a single response message.
